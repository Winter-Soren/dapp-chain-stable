# Assessment Framework Overview

This framework aims to address the sustainability concerns surrounding Proof of Work (PoW)-based blockchain networks. By developing a comprehensive assessment framework, we endeavor to evaluate the sustainability of PoW algorithms deployed within our proposed blockchain system.

## Objectives

1. **Assessment Framework Development**: We are crafting a robust framework to assess the sustainability of PoW algorithms. This framework will consider various critical factors, including:
   - Carbon footprint
   - CPU temperature
   - Memory usage
   - GPU core utilization
   - Scalability challenges

2. **Analysis and Evaluation**: Through rigorous analysis, we seek to gain insights into the environmental impact and resource utilization associated with different PoW algorithms. By evaluating these factors, we aim to identify opportunities for improvement and optimization.

3. **Course Charting Towards Sustainability**: Our study endeavors to chart a course towards greater resource efficiency and overall sustainability in blockchain technology. By addressing sustainability concerns head-on, we aim to contribute to the long-term viability and adoption of blockchain systems.

## Methodology

Our methodology involves a multi-faceted approach, including:
- Data collection: Gathering data on various parameters such as energy consumption, hardware utilization, and environmental impact.
- Analysis: Employing statistical and computational methods to analyze the collected data and derive meaningful insights.
- Benchmarking: Comparing different PoW algorithms against predefined benchmarks to assess their sustainability performance.
- Validation: Validating our findings through peer review and real-world experimentation.

## Expected Outcomes

Through our efforts, we anticipate the following outcomes:
- Identification of sustainable PoW algorithms: Highlighting algorithms that offer a balance between security, efficiency, and environmental impact.
- Guidelines for sustainable blockchain development: Providing actionable recommendations for developers to enhance the sustainability of their blockchain projects.
- Awareness and advocacy: Raising awareness about the importance of sustainability in blockchain technology and advocating for environmentally responsible practices.

## Conclusion

Our project represents a proactive step towards addressing the sustainability challenges associated with PoW-based blockchain networks. By leveraging comprehensive assessment methods and data-driven insights, we strive to foster a more sustainable future for blockchain technology.
